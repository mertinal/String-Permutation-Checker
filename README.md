# Strings-Permutation-Compare
This project checks for the presence of permutations of two words.

# Using : 
Open main.py files and call to checkStrings paramater for testing.

# Description
  In this python function I firstly declared to status False.If the condition is met in the continuation of the code, I changed it to True.
  
  These two lines line up the characters and assign them to a list of characters, and then put them together again as a string.
  In the next step, it will assist in terminating the loop and gain performance.
  
  >str1 = ''.join(sorted("".join(str1)))
  
  >str2 = ''.join(sorted("".join(str2)))
  
  This line checks the equality of the strings. If it is equal it already satisfies the condition
  >if(str1 == str2):
  
  In the other comparison lines, I searched for the word with a small number of characters in the other word.
